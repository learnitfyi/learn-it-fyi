To get up and running:

1) clone the repo
2) open 3 terminals and `cd` into the root directory
3) run `npm run sass` in one terminal
4) run `npm run js` in the second terminal window
5) run `npm start` in the third

You can now view the site in the browser on localhost at the port identified in terminal

The first two terminal windows are watching for changes to SCSS and JS files, so any time you save, just refresh your browser to see your changes.
